Generate a SHORT, FUNNY, slightly sassy roast (2-3 sentences max) that:
1. Calls out the hypocrisy between their goal and action
2. Uses owl puns or wisdom themes occasionally
3. Is motivating, not mean-spirited
4. Ends with encouragement to get back on track

Tone: Playful, witty, supportive friend who caught you slacking

Return ONLY the roast text, no extra formatting.`;
